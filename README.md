# Memories App


The "Memories" project is a Full Stack MERN application built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It is a simple social media app where users can create, read, update, and delete posts about significant events in their lives, sharing memorable moments with others.


Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app

TODO: rename post message, refactor reducers, add some cool memories, maybe clickable tags, fix update functionality
